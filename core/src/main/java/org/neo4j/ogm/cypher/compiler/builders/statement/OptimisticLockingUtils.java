/**
 * Provides fragments that implement optimistic locking logic via Cypher.
 * The main logic is as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@code AND n.`version` = {version}} Ensure that we only match the current version</li>
 * <li>{@code SET n.`version` = n.`version` + 1} Take the lock by incrementing the version of the record in this transaction</li>
 * <li>{@code WITH n WHERE n.version = {version} + 1} Add a second version check in case another transaction took the lock between our read and upgrade</li>
 * </ol>
 * For new nodes we take a merge into account and therefor check whether the record to upgrade has a version or not.
 * If it doesn't have a version yet, we start at 0.
