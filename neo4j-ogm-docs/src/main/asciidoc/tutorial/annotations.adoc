[[tutorial-annotations]]
= Annotations

Neo4j OGM supports mapping annotated and non-annotated objects models.
Itâ€™s possible to save any POJO with the exception of a Relationship Entity without annotations to the graph.
The framework will then apply conventions to decide what to do.

== Maven dependency

Before we can use the library, we need to add a dependency.

[[nodes-properties-labels]]
== Nodes, properties & labels

POJOs annotated with `@NodeEntity` will be represented as nodes in the graph.
The label assigned to this node can be specified via the `label` property on the annotation; if not specified, it will default to the simple class name of the entity.
Each parent class in addition also contributes a label to the entity (with the exception of `java.lang.Object`).
This is useful when we want to retrieve collections of super types.

Let's go ahead and annotate all our node entities.
Note that we're overriding the default label for a `Course` with `Class`

[source, java]
----
@NodeEntity
public class Department {
    private String name;
    private Set<Subject> subjects;
}

@NodeEntity
public class Subject {
    private String name;
    private Department department;
    private Set<Teacher> teachers;
    private Set<Course> courses;
}

@NodeEntity
public class Teacher {
    private String name;
    private Set<Course> courses;
    private Set<Subject> subjects;
}

@NodeEntity(label="Class")
public class Course {
    private String name;
    private Subject subject;
    private Teacher teacher;
    private Set<Enrollment> enrollments;
}

@NodeEntity
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private Set<Enrollment> enrollments;
    private Set<StudyBuddy> studyBuddies;
}
----


[[runtime-managed-labels]]
=== Runtime managed labels

As stated above, the label applied to a node is the contents of the `@NodeEntity` label property, or if not specified, it will default to the simple class name of the entity.
Sometimes it might be necessary to add and remove additional labels to a node at _runtime_.
We can do this using the `@Labels` annotation.
Let's provide a facility for adding additional labels to the `Student` entity:

[source, java]
----
@NodeEntity
public class Student {

    @Labels
    private List<String> labels = new ArrayList<>();

}
----

Now, upon save, the node's labels will correspond to the entity's class hierarchy _plus_ whatever the contents of the backing field are.
We can use one `@Labels` field per class hierarchy - it should be exposed or hidden from sub-classes as appropriate.


[[relationships]]
== Relationships

Next up, the relationships between the nodes.
Every field in an entity that references another entity is backed by a relationship in the graph.
The `@Relationship` annotation allows you to specify both the type of the relationship and the direction.
By default, the direction is assumed to be `OUTGOING` and the type is the UPPER_SNAKE_CASE field name.
We're going to be specific about the relationship type to avoid using the default and also make it easier to refactor classes later by not being dependent on the field name.

[source, java]
----
@NodeEntity
public class Department {
    private String name;

    @Relationship(type = "CURRICULUM")
    private Set<Subject> subjects;
}

@NodeEntity
public class Subject {
    private String name;

    @Relationship(type="CURRICULUM", direction = Relationship.INCOMING)
    private Department department;

    @Relationship(type = "TAUGHT_BY")
    private Set<Teacher> teachers;

    @Relationship(type = "SUBJECT_TAUGHT", direction = "INCOMING")
    private Set<Course> courses;
}

@NodeEntity
public class Teacher {
    private String name;

     @Relationship(type="TEACHES_CLASS")
     private Set<Course> courses;

     @Relationship(type="TAUGHT_BY", direction = Relationship.INCOMING)
     private Set<Subject> subjects;
}

@NodeEntity(label="Class")
public class Course {
    private String name;

     @Relationship(type= "SUBJECT_TAUGHT")
     private Subject subject;

     @Relationship(type= "TEACHES_CLASS", direction=Relationship.INCOMING)
     private Teacher teacher;

     @Relationship(type= "ENROLLED", direction=Relationship.INCOMING)
     private Set<Enrollment> enrollments = new HashSet<>();
}

@NodeEntity
public class Student {
    private String name;

    @Relationship(type = "ENROLLED")
    private Set<Enrollment> enrollments;

    @Relationship(type = "BUDDY", direction = Relationship.INCOMING)
    private Set<StudyBuddy> studyBuddies;
}
----


[[relationship-entities]]
== Relationship entities

We have one more entity, and that is the `Enrollment`.
As discussed earlier, this is a relationship entity since it manages the underlying `ENROLLED` relation between a student and course.
It isn't a simple relation because it has a relationship property called `enrolledDate`.

A relationship entity must be annotated with `@RelationshipEntity` and also the type of relationship.
In this case, the type of relationship is `ENROLLED` as specified in both the `Student` and `Course` entities.
We are also going to indicate to the OGM the start and end node of this relationship.

[source, java]
----
@RelationshipEntity(type = "ENROLLED")
public class Enrollment {

    private Long id;

    @StartNode
    private Student student;

    @EndNode
    private Course course;

    private Date enrolledDate;

}
----


[[graphid]]
== @GraphId

Every node and relationship persisted to the graph has an id.
Neo4j OGM uses this to identify and re-connect the entity to the graph.
Specifying a Long id field is required.
If such a field exists on the entity, then Neo4j OGM will use it automatically.
Otherwise, a Long field must be annotated with `@GraphId`.

Since every entity requires an id, we're going to create an `Entity` superclass.
This is an abstract class, so you'll see that the nodes do not inherit an `Entity` label, which is exactly what we want.

If you plan on implementing `hashCode` and `equals` make sure *it does not* make sure of the Graph Id. See <<reference-graphid-annotation, Node Entities>> for more information.
[source, java]
----
public abstract class Entity {

    private Long id;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }
}
----

Our entities will now extend this class, for example

[source, java]
----
@NodeEntity
public class Department extends Entity {
    private String name;

    @Relationship(type = "CURRICULUM")
    private Set<Subject> subjects;

    public Department() {

    }
}
----

The OGM also requires an public no-args constructor to be able to construct objects, we'll make sure all our entities have one.


[[converters]]
== Converters

Neo4j supports numerics, Strings, booleans and arrays of these as property values.
How do we handle the `enrolledDate` since `Date` is not a valid data type?
Luckily for us, Neo4j OGM provides many converters out of the box, one of which is a Date to Long converter.
We simply annotate the field with `@DateLong` and the conversion of the Date to it's Long representation and back is handled by the OGM when persisting and loading from the graph.

[source, java]
----
@RelationshipEntity(type = "ENROLLED")
public class Enrollment {

    private Long id;

    @StartNode
    private Student student;

    @EndNode
    private Course course;

    @DateLong
    private Date enrolledDate;

}
