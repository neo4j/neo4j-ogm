== 3.2.1

* Fix API compatibility issues with Spring Data Neo4j 5.1.x series.

== 3.2.0

* Removed "neo4j.ha.properties.file" property from OGM configuration. Use "neo4j.conf.location" instead.
* Removed `org.neo4j.ogm.autoindex.AutoIndexManager#build`. Use `org.neo4j.ogm.autoindex.AutoIndexManager#run` instead.
* Removed deprecated and unsupported method `org.neo4j.ogm.session.Neo4jSession#setDriver`.
* Removed deprecated `@GraphId`. Please use a `Long` field annotated with `@Id @GeneratedValue` instead.
* Removed deprecated `org.neo4j.ogm.session.Session.doInTransaction(GraphCallback<T>)`. SDN doesn't use that from 5.1.4
  upwards anymore.
* Allow configuration of packages to scan in `ogm.properties` through `base-packages`. (#131)
* Removed deprecated and unused ServiceNotFoundException for good this time. (#319)
* Removed deprecated `org.neo4j.ogm.session.Neo4jException`. (#319)

* Improved hashing in IdentityMap and MappedRelationship. (#579)
* Deprecated OgmPluginInitializer.
* Don't deploy `org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-test` any longer. This module and the included utilities is not meant to be used outside Neo4j-OGM.
* `SessionFactory.getDriver()` has been replaced with `SessionFactory.unwrap(Class<T> clazz)` which provides a consistent
  way to get the underlying Neo4j-OGM driver or the native driver.
* Wrap CypherModificationProvider in a ThreadLocal.
