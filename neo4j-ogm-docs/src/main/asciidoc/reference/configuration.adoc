== Configuration method

There are several ways to supply configuration to the OGM:

- using a properties file
- programmatically using Java
- by providing an already configured neo4j java driver instance

These methods are described below. They are also available as code in the <<index.adoc#introduction:additional-resources:help, examples>>.

[[reference:configuration:method:properties]]
=== Using a properties file

----
ConfigurationSource props = new ClasspathConfigurationSource("my.properties");
Configuration configuration = new Configuration.Builder(props).build();
----

[[reference:configuration:method:java]]
=== Programmatically using Java

In cases where you are not be able to provide configuration via a properties file you can  configure the OGM programmatically instead.

The `Configuration` object provides a fluent API to set various configuration options. This object then needs to be supplied to the
`SessionFactory` constructor in order to be configured.

=== By providing a neo4j driver instance

Just configure the driver as you would do for direct access to the database, and pass the driver instance to the session factory.

This method allows the greatest flexibility and gives you access to the full range of low level configuration options.

.Example providing a bolt driver instance to OGM
[source, java]
----
org.neo4j.driver.v1.Driver nativeDriver = ...;
Driver ogmDriver = new BoltDriver(nativeDriver);
new SessionFactory(ogmDriver, ...);

== Driver Configuration

[[reference:configuration:driver:http]]
=== HTTP Driver


.Basic HTTP Driver Configuration
[%autowidth.spread,frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|ogm.properties   | Java Configuration

a|
[source, properties]
----
URI=http://user:password@localhost:7474
----

a|
[source, java]
----
Configuration configuration = new Configuration.Builder()
        .uri("http://user:password@localhost:7474")
        .build()
----
|======================

[[reference:configuration:driver:bolt]]
=== Bolt Driver


Note that for the `URI`, if no port is specified, the default Bolt port of `7687` is used. Otherwise, a port can be specified with `bolt://neo4j:password@localhost:1234`

Also, the bolt driver allows you to define a connection pool size, which refers to the maximum number of sessions per URL.
This property is optional and defaults to `50`

.Basic Bolt Driver Configuration
[%autowidth.spread,frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|ogm.properties   | Java Configuration

a|
[source, properties]
----
URI=bolt://neo4j:password@localhost
connection.pool.size=150
----

a|
[source, java]
----
Configuration configuration = new Configuration.Builder()
        .uri("bolt://neo4j:password@localhost")
        .setConnectionPoolSize(150)
        .build()
----
|======================

A timeout to the database with the Bolt driver can be set by updating your Database's `neo4j.conf`. The exact setting
to change can be http://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.transaction.timeout[found here].

[[reference:configuration:driver:embedded]]
=== Embedded Driver


You should use the Embedded driver if you don't want to use a client-server model, or if your application is running as a Neo4j Unmanaged Extension.
You can specify a permanent data store location to provide durability of your data after your application shuts down, or you can use an impermanent data store, which will only exist while your application is running.

[NOTE]
As of 2.1.0 the Neo4j OGM embedded driver no longer ships with the Neo4j kernel.  Users are expected to provide this dependency through their
dependency management system. See <<reference:getting-started, Getting Started>> for more details.

.Permanent Data Store Embedded Driver Configuration
[%autowidth.spread,frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|ogm.properties   | Java Configuration

[source, properties]
----
URI=file:///var/tmp/neo4j.db

----
Configuration configuration = new Configuration.Builder()
             .uri("file:///var/tmp/neo4j.db")
             .build()
----
|======================

To use an impermanent data store which will be deleted on shutdown of the JVM, you just omit the URI attribute.

[[reference:configuration:driver:embedded:unmanaged]]
==== Configuration in an Unmanaged Extension

When your application is running as unmanaged extension inside the Neo4j server itself, you will need to set up OGM configuration slightly differently.
Neo4j provides `PluginLifecycle` SPI that allows to initialize extensions. Extend `OgmPluginInitializer` and list the full class name in
`META-INF/services/org.neo4j.server.plugins.PluginLifecycle`:


[source, java]
----
public class MyApplicationPluginInitializer extends OgmPluginInitializer {

    public MyApplicationPluginInitializer() {
        super(MyDomain.class.getPackage().getName());
    }
}
----

This provides `SessionFactory` as injectable in your resources:

[source, java]
----
@Path("/movies")
public static class MovieService {

    @Context
    private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    ...
}
----
[NOTE]
Don't forget to list your resources in `dbms.unmanaged_extension_classes` property in neo4j configuration file as you
would with any other unmanaged extension.


[[reference:configuration:driver:credentials]]
=== Credentials

If you are using the HTTP or Bolt Driver you have a number of different ways to supply credentials to the Driver Configuration.

[%autowidth.spread,frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|ogm.properties   | Java Configuration

a|
[source, properties]
----
# embedded
URI=http://user:password@localhost:7474

# separately
username="user"
password="password"
----

a|
[source, java]
----
// embedded
Configuration configuration = new Configuration.Builder()
             .uri("bolt://user:password@localhost")
             .build()

// separately as plain text
Configuration configuration = new Configuration.Builder()
             .credentials("user", "password)
             .build()
----
|======================

_Note: Currently only Basic Authentication is supported by the OGM. If you need to use more advanced authentication scheme, use the native driver configuration method_

[[reference:configuration:driver:tsl]]
=== Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL)

The Bolt and Http drivers also allow you to connect to Neo4j over a secure channel. These rely on Transport Layer Security (aka SSL) and require the installation of a signed certificate on the server.

In certain situations (e.g. some cloud environments) it may not be possible to install a signed certificate even though you still want to use an encrypted connection.

To support this, both drivers have configuration settings allowing you to bypass certificate checking, although they differ in their implementation.

[NOTE]
Both these strategies leave you vulnerable to a MITM attack. You should probably not use them unless your servers are behind a secure firewall.

[[reference:configuration:driver:security:bolt]]
==== Bolt

[%autowidth.spread,frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|ogm.properties   | Java Configuration

a|
[source, properties]
----
#Encryption level (TLS), optional, defaults to REQUIRED.
#Valid values are NONE,REQUIRED
encryption.level=REQUIRED

#Trust strategy, optional, not used if not specified.
#Valid values are TRUST_ON_FIRST_USE,TRUST_SIGNED_CERTIFICATES
trust.strategy=TRUST_ON_FIRST_USE

#Trust certificate file, required if trust.strategy is specified
trust.certificate.file=/tmp/cert

# interval, in milliseconds, to check for stale db connections (test-on-borrow)
connection.liveness.check.timeout=1000
----

a|
[source, java]
----
Configuration config = new Configuration.Builder()
    ...
    .encryptionLevel("REQUIRED")
    .trustStrategy("TRUST_ON_FIRST_USE")
    .trustCertFile("/tmp/cert")
    .connectionLivenessCheckTimeout(1000)
    .build();
----
|======================


`TRUST_ON_FIRST_USE` means that the Bolt Driver will trust the first connection to a host to be safe and intentional. On subsequent connections, the driver will verify that the host is the same as on that first connection.

[[reference:configuration:driver:bolt]]
==== HTTP

[%autowidth.spread,frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|ogm.properties   | Java Configuration

a|
[source, properties]
----
trust.strategy = ACCEPT_UNSIGNED
----

a|
[source, java]
----
Configuration configuration = new Configuration.Builder()
        .trustStrategy("ACCEPT_UNSIGNED")
        .build()
----
|======================


The `ACCEPT_UNSIGNED` strategy permits the Http Driver to accept Neo4j's default `snakeoil.cert` (and any other) unsigned certificate when connecting over HTTPS.

=== Eager connection verification

OGM by default does not connect to Neo4j server when it is configured.
This allows you to start the application and database independently and Neo4j will be accessed on first read/write.
To change this behaviour set the property `verify.connection` (or `Builder.verifyConnection(boolean)`) to true.
This settings is valid only for Bolt and HTTP drivers.

[[reference:configuration:logging]]
== Logging

Neo4j OGM uses SLF4J to log statements. In production, you can set the log level in a file called *logback.xml* to be found at the root of the classpath.
Please see the link:http://logback.qos.ch/manual/[Logback manual] for further details.
