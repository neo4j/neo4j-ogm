=== Transitive dependencies

The following table list transitive dependencies between specific versions of projects related to Neo4j-OGM.
When reporting issues or asking for help on StackOverflow or neo4j-users slack channel always
verify versions used (e.g through `mvn dependency:tree`) and report them as well.

NOTE: Starting with Spring Boot 2.4, Spring Data Neo4j (version 6+) does not include Neo4j-OGM anymore.

[[reference:getting-started:dependency-management]]
== Dependency Management

For building an application, your build automation tool needs to be configured to include the Neo4j-OGM dependencies.

Neo4j-OGM dependencies consist of `neo4j-ogm-core`, together with the relevant dependency declarations on the driver you want to use.
Neo4j-OGM provides support for connecting to Neo4j by configuring one of the following Drivers:

- `neo4j-ogm-bolt-driver` - Uses native Bolt protocol to communicate between Neo4j-OGM and a remote Neo4j instance.
- `neo4j-ogm-bolt-native-types` - Support for all of Neo4j's property types through the Bolt protocol.
- `neo4j-ogm-http-driver` - Uses HTTP to communicate between Neo4j-OGM and a remote Neo4j instance.
- `neo4j-ogm-embedded-driver` - Creates an in-memory Neo4j instance and uses it.
- `neo4j-ogm-embedded-native-types` - Support for all of Neo4j's property types in an embedded scenario.

Neo4j-OGM projects can be built using Maven, Gradle or any other build system that utilises Maven's artifact repository structure.

[[reference:getting-started:dependency-management:maven]]
=== Maven

In the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml` add the following:

.Maven dependencies
[source, xml, subs="attributes, specialcharacters"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-ogm-core</artifactId>
    <version>{ogm-version}</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- Only add if you're using the Bolt driver -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-ogm-bolt-driver</artifactId>
    <version>{ogm-version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- Only add if you're using the HTTP driver -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-ogm-http-driver</artifactId>
    <version>{ogm-version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

<!-- Only add if you're using the Embedded driver -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-ogm-embedded-driver</artifactId>
    <version>{ogm-version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j</artifactId>
    <version>{neo4j-version}</version>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----

Please also have a look at <<reference:native-property-types:supported-drivers, the native type system>> to take advantage of Neo4j-OGM's support for native temporal and spatial types.

[[reference:getting-started:dependency-management:gradle]]
=== Gradle

Ensure the following dependencies are added to you `build.gradle`:

.Gradle dependencies
[source, groovy, subs="attributes"]
----
dependencies {
    compile 'org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-core:{ogm-version}'
    runtime 'org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-bolt-driver:{ogm-version}' // Only add if you're using the Bolt driver
    runtime 'org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-http-driver:{ogm-version}' // Only add if you're using the HTTP driver
    runtime 'org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-embedded-driver:{ogm-version}' //  Only add if you're using the Embedded driver
    runtime 'org.neo4j:neo4j:{neo4j-version}' //  Only add if you're using the Embedded driver
}
