= Filters

Filters provide a mechanism for customising the where clause of Cypher generated by Neo4j-OGM.
They can be chained together with boolean operators, and associated with a comparison operator.
Additionally, each filter contains a `FilterFunction`.
A filter function can be provided when the filter is instantiated, otherwise, by default a `PropertyComparison` is used.

In the example below, we're return a collection containing any satellites that are manned.


.Example of using a Filter
[source,java]
----
Collection<Satellite> satellites = session.loadAll(Satellite.class, new Filter("manned", ComparisonOperator.EQUALS, true));
----

.Example of chained Filters
[source,java]
----
Filter mannedFilter = new Filter("manned", ComparisonOperator.EQUALS, true);
Filter landedFilter = new Filter("landed", ComparisonOperator.EQUALS, false);

Filters satelliteFilter = mannedFilter.and(landedFilter);
----

WARNING: The filters should be considered as immutable.
In previous versions, you could change filter values after instantiation, this is not the case anymore.
