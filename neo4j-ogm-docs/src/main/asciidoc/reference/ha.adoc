= Clustering Support

[NOTE]
The clustering features are only available in Neo4j Enterprise Edition.


Neo4j offers two separate solutions for ensuring redundancy and performance in a high-demand production environment:

- Causal Clustering
- Highly Available (HA) Cluster

Neo4j 3.1 introduced Causal Clustering – a brand-new architecture using the state-of-the-art Raft protocol – that enables support for ultra-large clusters and a wider range of cluster topologies for data center and cloud.

A Neo4j HA cluster is comprised of a single primary instance and zero or more secondary instances.

[NOTE]
Please note that the HA technology is deprecated since Neo4j 3.4.

All instances in the cluster have full copies of the data in their local database files.
The basic cluster configuration usually consists of three instances.

== Causal Clustering

To find out more about Causal Clustering architecture please see https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/[the reference].

Causal Clustering only works with the Neo4j Bolt Driver (`1.1.0` onwards).
Trying to set this up with the HTTP or Embedded Driver will not work.
The Bolt driver will fully handle any load balancing, which operate in concert with the Causal Cluster to spread the workload.
New cluster-aware sessions, managed on the client-side by the Bolt drivers, alleviate complex infrastructure concerns for developers.

[[reference:ha:causal-clustering:configuration]]
=== Configuring Neo4j-OGM

_Not cluster specific side note: you may also want to configure <<reference:configuration:driver:connection-test, connection testing>>_.

To use clustering, simply configure your Bolt URI to use the bolt routing protocol:

[source, configs]
----
URI=bolt+routing://instance0 <1>
----
or
[source, configs]
----
URIS=bolt+routing://instance0 <1>
----
<1> `instance0` must be one of your core cluster group (that accepts reads and writes).


[[reference:ha:causal-clustering:design-considerations]]
=== Design considerations for clustering

In this section we go through important points to be aware of when using causal clustering.

* Review hardware and cluster configuration
* Target replica servers when possible
* Use bookmarks to read your own writes
* Plan for failure

=== Cluster configuration

Please read the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/causal-clustering/[causal cluster reference] to plan the best topology according to your needs.

You can provide additional core instances in `URIS` property, separated by a comma.
The `URI` property is optional as long as all URIs are provided in the `URIS` property.
Same credentials are used for all instances.
Please keep in mind that all listed instances must be core servers.

[source, configs]
----
URI=bolt+routing://instance0
URIS=bolt+routing://instance1,bolt+routing://instance2

[[reference:ha:causal-clustering:sessions]]
=== Target replica servers when possible

By default all `Session` 's `Transaction` s are set to read/write.
This means reads and writes will always hit the core cluster.
To offload the core servers and improve performance, it is advised if possible to route traffic to the replica servers.
This is done in the application code, by declaring sessions / transactions as read-only.
You can call `session.beginTransaction(Transaction.Type)` with `READ` to do that.

NOTE: This is not always possible.
You may only do this if you can afford to read some slightly outdated data.

[[reference:ha:causal-clustering:bookmarks]]
=== Use bookmarks to read your own writes

Causal consistency allows you to specify guarantees around query ordering, including the
*ability to read your own writes*, view the last data you read, and later on,
committed writes from other users.
The Bolt drivers collaborate with the core servers to ensure that all transactions are applied in the same order using a concept of a bookmark.

The cluster returns a bookmark when it commits an update transaction, so then the driver links a bookmark to the user’s next transaction.
The server that received query *starts this new bookmarked transaction only when its internal state reached the desired bookmark*.
This ensures that the view of related data is always consistent, that all servers are eventually updated, and that users
reading and re-reading data always see the same — and the latest — data.

If you have multiple application tier JVM instances you will need to manage this state across them.
The `Session` object allows you to retrieve bookmarks through the use of `Session.getLastBookmark()` and
start new transactions with given bookmark through `Session.beginTransaction(type, bookmarks)`.

NOTE: Do not generalize the use of bookmarks as they have impact on latency.

=== Retry mechanisms

The driver does its best to ensure a stable communication between the application tier and the database.
It handles low level failures (like connection loss), but cannot do much about higher level failures (like cluster unavailability).
However, due to the nature of distributed platforms, failures arise.
When the cluster is split among several datacenters, network issues can cause cluster instability.
Cluster members not being able to talk to each other can make the cluster, for example, fall in read only mode, or trigger leader re-election.

For critical applications, these failures have to be anticipated, and also managed at the architecture or application level.
Even if the driver handles some low level retries, it is not always enough in case of instability,
as an application may involve complex business logic, and require coarse grained units of work.

Solutions like application retries or message queuing are good candidates to handle this kind of scenario.

[[reference:ha:ha-cluster]]
== Highly Available (HA) Cluster

A typical Neo4j HA cluster will consist of a primary node and a couple of secondary nodes for providing failover capability and optionally for handling reads.
(Although it is possible to write to secondary nodes, this is uncommon because it requires additional effort to synchronise a secondary node with the primary node node.)

[[reference:ha:ha-cluster:transactions]]
=== Transaction binding in HA mode

When operating in HA mode, Neo4j does not make open transactions available across all nodes in the cluster.
This means we must bind every request within a specific transaction to the same node in the cluster, or the commit will fail with `404 Not Found`.

[[reference:ha:ha-cluster:readwrite]]
=== Read-only transactions

As of Version 2.0.5 read-only transactions are supported by Neo4j-OGM.

[[reference:ha:ha-cluster:readwrite:drivers]]
==== Drivers
The Drivers have been updated to transmit additional information about the transaction type of the current transaction to the server.

- The HTTP Driver implementation sets a HTTP Header "X-WRITE" to "1" for READ_WRITE transactions (the default) or to "0" for READ_ONLY ones.

- The Embedded Driver can support both READ_ONLY and READ_WRITE (as of version `2.1.0`).

- The native Bolt Driver can support both READ_ONLY and READ_WRITE (as of version `2.1.0`).
