== Metadata collection

Metadata is collected about persistent entities in `Metadata` which provides it to any part of the library.
This information is gathered by reading the class files directly rather than loading via reflection, resulting in much faster startup times.

The metadata holds all the required object-graph mapping information for each type.
This metadata is discovered at start-up by specifying a list of packages in which all classes are scanned, including those in sub-packages.
In order to omit a class from being metadata-mapped you should annotate it with `@Transient`.



== Fine-grained control via depth specification
