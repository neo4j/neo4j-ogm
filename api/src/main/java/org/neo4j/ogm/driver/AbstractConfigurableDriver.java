/**
 * The AbstractConfigurableDriver is used by all drivers to register themselves.
 * The register method takes a generic {@link Configuration} object, which is used to register the
 * driver appropriately. This object contains of one or more key-value
 * pairs. Every driver configuration must contain a mandatory key "URI", whose corresponding value is
 * a text representation of the driver uri, for example:
 * setConfig("URI", "http://username:password@hostname:port")
 * if credentials are not present the URI, they can be specified in one of
 * two ways, either as a plain text username/password key-values pair in the configuration e.g.
 * setConfig("username", "bilbo")
 * setConfig("password", "hobbit")
 * or, alternatively using the "credentials" key
 * setConfig("credentials", new UsernamePasswordCredentials("bilbo", "hobbit")
