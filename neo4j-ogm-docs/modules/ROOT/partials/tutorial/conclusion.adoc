= Conclusion

With not much effort, we've built all the services that tie together this application.
All that is required is adding controllers and building the UI.
The fully functioning application is available at https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-ogm-university[Github].

We encourage you to read the reference guide that follows and apply the concepts learned by forking the application and adding to it.
