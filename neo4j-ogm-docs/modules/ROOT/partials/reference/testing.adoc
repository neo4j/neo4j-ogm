= Testing

Doing integration testing with Neo4j-OGM requires a few basic steps :

* Add the `neo4j-ogm-test` artifact in you maven / gradle configuration
* Declare the `Neo4jRule` JUnit rule, to setup a Neo4j test server
* Setup Neo4j-OGM configuration and `SessionFactory`

An example of a full running configuration can be found in the https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-sdn-ogm-issue-report-template/blob/master/ogm-3.0/src/test/java/org/neo4j/ogm/test/OgmTestCase.java[issue templates]

[[reference:testing:log-levels]]
== Log levels

When running unit tests, it can be useful to see what Neo4j-OGM is doing, and in particular to see the Cypher requests being transferred between your application and the database.
Neo4j-OGM uses `slf4j` along with `Logback` as its logging framework and by default the log level for all Neo4j-OGM components is set to WARN, which does not include any Cypher output.
To change Neo4j-OGM log level, create a file *logback-test.xml* in your test resources folder, configured as shown below:

.logback-test.xml
[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>

    <appender name="console" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>%d %5p %40.40c:%4L - %m%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <!--
      ~ Set the required log level for Neo4j-OGM components here.
      ~ To just see Cypher statements set the level to "info"
      ~ For finer-grained diagnostics, set the level to "debug".
    -->
    <logger name="org.neo4j.ogm" level="info" />

    <root level="warn">
        <appender-ref ref="console" />
    </root>

</configuration>
