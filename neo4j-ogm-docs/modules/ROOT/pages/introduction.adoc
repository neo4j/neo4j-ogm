This chapter is an introduction to graph databases, Neo4j, and the Neo4j object-graph mapping library (Neo4j-OGM).
It also outlines requirements and where to get support. 

If you are already familiar with Neo4j and Neo4j-OGM, feel free to jump directly

[[introduction:ogm]]
== What is an OGM?

An OGM (Object Graph Mapper) maps nodes and relationships in the graph to objects and references in a domain model.
Object instances are mapped to nodes while object references are mapped using relationships, or serialized to properties.
JVM primitives are mapped to node or relationship properties.
An OGM abstracts the database and provides a convenient way to persist your domain model in the graph and query it without using low level drivers.
It also provides the flexibility to the developer to supply custom queries where the queries generated by Neo4j-OGM are insufficient.


[[introduction:ogm:introducing-ogm]]
=== Introducing the Neo4j-OGM

Developing Java Business Applications often requires mapping rich domain models to your database.
The Neo4j-OGM library is a pure Java library that can persist (annotated) domain objects using Neo4j.
It uses Cypher statements to handle those operations in Neo4j.

Neo4j-OGM supports tracking changes to minimize necessary updates and transitive persistence (reading and updating neighborhoods of an object).

The connection to Neo4j handled by a transport mode layer called driver, which can use the binary protocol, HTTP or Neo4jâ€™s embedded APIs.
