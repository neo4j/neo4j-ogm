= Connecting to the Graph

In order to interact with mapped entities and the Neo4j graph, your application will require a `Session`, which is provided by the `SessionFactory`.

[[reference:connecting:session-factory]]
== SessionFactory

The `SessionFactory` is needed by OGM to create instances of `Session` as required.
This also sets up the object-graph mapping metadata when constructed, which is then used across all `Session` objects that it creates.
The packages to scan for domain object metadata should be provided to the `SessionFactory` constructor.
Multiple packages may be provided as well.
If you would rather just pass in specific classes you can also do that via an overloaded constructor.
The SessionFactory must also be configured.
There are two ways this can be done.
Please see the section below on Configuration for further details.

.Multiple packages
[source, java]
----
SessionFactory sessionFactory = new SessionFactory("first.package.domain", "second.package.domain",...);
----

Note that the `SessionFactory` should typically be set up once during life of your application.
