Neo4j OGM University is a demo application for the Neo4j OGM library.

It is a fully functioning web-application built using the following components

* Spring Boot
* Neo4j OGM
* Angular.js
* Twitter Bootstrap UI

The application's domain is a fictitious educational institution - Hilly Fields Technical College.

It leverages the power of Spring Boot and in particular the new Neo4j Object Graph mapping technology to provide a
RESTful interface with which the web client interacts.
The application is entirely stateless; every interaction involves a call to a Neo4j server, hopefully demonstrating the
speed of the technology, even over the wire.
