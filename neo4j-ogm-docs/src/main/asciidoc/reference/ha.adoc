= High Availability (HA) Support

[NOTE]
The clustering features are available in Neo4j Enterprise Edition.


Neo4j offers two separate solutions for ensuring redundancy and performance in a high-demand production environment:

- Causal Clustering
- Highly Available (HA) Cluster

Neo4j 3.1 introduced Causal Clustering – a brand-new architecture using the state-of-the-art Raft protocol – that enables support for ultra-large clusters and a wider range of cluster topologies for data center and cloud.

A Neo4j HA cluster is comprised of a single master instance and zero or more slave instances. All instances in the cluster have full copies of the data in their local database files. The basic cluster configuration usally consists of three instances.

[[reference:ha:causal-clustering]]
== Causal Clustering

To find out more about Causal Clustering architecture please see: https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/beta/clustering/causal-clustering/.

Causal Clustering only works with the Neo4j Bolt Driver (`1.1.0` onwards). Trying to set this up with the HTTP or Embedded Driver will not work.
The bolt driver will fully handle any load balancing, which operate in concert with the Causal Cluster to spread the workload. New cluster-aware sessions, managed on the client-side by the Bolt drivers, alleviate complex infrastructure concerns for developers.

[[reference:ha:causal-clustering:configuration]]
=== Configuring the OGM

To use clustering, simply configure your bolt URI (in `ogm.properties` or through `Components.driver().setURI()`) to use the bolt routing protocol:

[source, configs]
----
URI=bolt+routing://instance0

----

`instance0` must be one of your core cluster group (that accepts reads and writes).

[[reference:ha:causal-clustering:sessions]]
=== Using OGM Sessions.

By default all `Session` 's `Transaction` s are set to read/write. This means
reads and writes will always hit the core cluster. In order to break this up you can call `session.beginTransaction(Transaction.Type)` with
READ to hit the replica servers.

[[reference:ha:causal-clustering:bookmarks]]
=== Bookmarks

Causal consistency allows you to specify guarantees around query ordering, including the ability to read your own writes, view the last data you read, and later on, committed writes from other users. The Bolt drivers collaborate with the core servers to ensure that all transactions are applied in the same order using a concept of a bookmark.

The cluster returns a bookmark when it commits an update transaction, so then the driver links a bookmark to the user’s next transaction. The server that received query starts this new bookmarked transaction only when its internal state reached the desired bookmark. This ensures that the view of related data is always consistent, that all servers are eventually updated, and that users reading and re-reading data always see the same — and the latest — data.

If you have multiple application tier JVM instances you will need to manage this state across them. The `Session` object
allows you to set and retrieve bookmarks through the use of: `Session.withBookmark()` and `Session.getLastBookmark()`.


[[reference:ha:ha-cluster]]
== Highly Available (HA) Cluster

A typical Neo4j HA cluster will consist of a master node and a couple of slave nodes for providing failover capability and optionally for handling reads.
(Although it is possible to write to slaves, this is uncommon because it requires additional effort to synchronise a slave with the master node)

[[reference:ha:ha-cluster:transactions]]
=== Transaction binding in HA mode

When operating in HA mode, Neo4j does not make open transactions available across all nodes in the cluster.
This means we must bind every request within a specific transaction to the same node in the cluster, or the commit will fail with `404 Not Found`.

[[reference:ha:ha-cluster:readwrite]]
=== Read-only transactions

As of Version 2.0.5 read-only transactions are supported by the OGM.

[[reference:ha:ha-cluster:readwrite:api-changes]]
==== API changes

There is new API method `session.beginTransaction(Transaction.Type)` where Transaction.Type is one of:

- READ_WRITE
- READ_ONLY

In the case that your code doesn't declare an explicit transaction, `autocommit` transactions (or their logical equivalent) will be created by the various drivers. These will be READ_WRITE.

The previous API semantics have not changed, i.e. `session.beginTransaction()` creates a READ_WRITE transaction.

[[reference:ha:ha-cluster:readwrite:drivers]]
==== Drivers
The Drivers have been updated to transmit additional information about the transaction type of the current transaction to the server.

- The HttpDriver implementation sets a Http Header "X-WRITE" to "1" for READ_WRITE transactions (the default) or to "0" for READ_ONLY ones.

- The Embedded Driver can support both READ_ONLY and READ_WRITE (as of version `2.1.0`).

- The native Bolt Driver can support both READ_ONLY and READ_WRITE (as of version `2.1.0`).



[[reference:ha:ha-cluster:load-balancer]]
=== Dynamic binding via a load balancer

In the Neo4j HA architecture, a cluster is typically fronted by a load balancer.

The following example shows how to configure your application and set up HAProxy as a load balancer to route write requests to whichever machine in the cluster is currently identified as the master, with read requests being distributed to any available machine in the cluster on a round-robin basis.

This configuration will also ensure that requests against a specific transaction are directed to the server where the transaction was created.
