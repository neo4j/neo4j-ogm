/**
 * The public API for metadata class loading in the OGM.
 *
 * Do not use Class.forName() because it may not work when frameworks
 * such as Play reconfigure the ClassLoader hierarchies. Instead, replace
 * all such calls with ReflectionUtils.forName()
 *
 * The principles behind this class loading technique are due to Vladimir Roubtsov,
 * as documented here: &lt;a href="http://www.javaworld.com/columns/jw-qna-index.shtml"&gt;
 *
 * If needed we can extend this class to load other types of resources apart from class files
