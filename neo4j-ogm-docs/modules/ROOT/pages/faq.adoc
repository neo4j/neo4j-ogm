What is the difference between Neo4j-OGM and Spring Data Neo4j (SDN)?::
  Spring Data Neo4j (SDN) up to version 5.3.x uses Neo4j-OGM under the covers.
  It's like Spring Data JPA, where JPA/Hibernate is the underlay.
  Most of the power of SDN actually comes from Neo4j-OGM.
  Starting with Spring Data Neo4j 6.x (Spring Boot 2.4) does not need Neo4j-OGM anymore.
  Please note that, intentionally, Neo4j-OGM 4+ does not work as a drop-in replacement for Spring Data 5.x.

How are labels generated when using inheritance?::
  All concrete classes generate a label, abstract classes and interfaces not.
  If any kind of class or interface gets annotated with @NodeEntity or @NodeEntity(label="customLabel") it will generate a label.
  Any class annotated with @Transient will not generate a label.
