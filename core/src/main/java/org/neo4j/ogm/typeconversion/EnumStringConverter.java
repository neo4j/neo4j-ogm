/**
 * By default the OGM will map enum objects to and from
 * the string value returned by enum.name()
 * enum.name() is preferred to enum.ordinal() because it
 * is (slightly) safer: a persisted enum have to be renamed
 * to break its database mapping, whereas if its ordinal
 * was persisted instead, the mapping would be broken
 * simply by changing the declaration order in the enum set.
