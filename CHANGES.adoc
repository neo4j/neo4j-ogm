=== 3.3.0

First release in the 3.3.x line. No changes compared to the latest 3.2.42 release, but using the latest Neo4j Java 4.4 driver as a baseline dependencies. If you don't manage the driver in your application yourself, this will affect your dependencies as well. By upgrading from a 4.0 driver to the 4.4 driver as baseline, Neo4j-OGM 3.3 effectively drops support for all versions of Neo4j database prior to 3.5.

Future supported versions of Neo4j-OGM will be 3.3 and 4.x. Neo4j-OGM 3.3 is for all projects that still require support for Neo4j 4.4 and 3.5. Neo4j-OGM 4.x is for all projects on Neo4j 4.4 or 5.

== 3.2

=== 3.2.43

* Make session related config of the BoltDriver available without complete driver reconfiguration.

=== 3.2.37

* [dependencies] Bump classgraph from 4.8.147 to 4.8.149
* [bug] Make reuse of existing builders threadsafe, check for property equality.

* Increment only version properties of changed relationship entities. (#903)
* [test] Add more tests for #902.

=== 3.2.32

* [bug] Don't flatten collections of known entities. (#902)
* [improvement] Avoid unnecessary creation of builders.

https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm/commit/60e5f51a3c499f756732004be5b9e0fa57e2f6a6[60e5f51] (the fix for #902) can lead to breaking changes
in some custom queries (all queries having several levels of nested lists of domain objects). They have been incorrectly
flattened before that change and their structure will be preserved afterwards.

An example. A query returning

[source]
----
[[n0, n1, n2], [n3], [n4], [n5, n6]]
----

with n1..6 being known domain objects will be flattened to a `[n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6]` prior to 3.2.32.
The above structure will now be preserved.

This also applies to pattern comprehensions like those:

[source]
----
MATCH (n:Movie{title:'Pulp Fiction'}) return n, [(n)-[r:UNKNOWN]-(p) | [r,p]] as relAndNode
----

prior to the fix, `relAndNode` would have been returned as a single array. Now it will be returned as a collection of arrays, exactly what the comprehension states.

We also make sure that in all scenarios, in which semantically wrong Cypher would be created, an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown, regardless if one tries to combined `NestedFilterOrOtherFilter` or `OtherFilterOrNestedFilter`. This may affect some derived finder methods in Spring Data Neo4j.

* Dependency upgrades
** Neo4j 3.4.18 and 3.5.19
** Neo4j Java Driver 4.0.2

* Return correct nullable references from Kotlin extension methods. (#765)
* Fix inconsistent behaviour of Driver.unwrap(). (#767)
* Explicitly use ISO based date- and timeformatters. (#768)

WARNING: The Kotlin extension methods `Session.load(id: Serializable, depth: Int = 1)`,
         `Session.queryForObject(cypher: String, parameters: Map<String, Any> = emptyMap())` and
         `SessionFactory.unwrap()` now return nullable references to be compatible with the actual
         Java methods. This is a breaking change but avoids `IllegalStateException` during runtime.
         Please see #765 for a discussion.
         `Driver.unwrap()` will no return `null` as long as the driver hasn't been used or has not been
         initialised through `verifyConnection(true)` on the configuration.

Thanks to our reporters and contributors @emptyfruit, @aslakagens and @TWiStErRob and also @lukehutch for your input.
