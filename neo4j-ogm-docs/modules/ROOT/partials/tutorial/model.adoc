= Building the domain model

Before we get to any code, we want to whiteboard our graph model.
We use https://arrows.app for this.

Our domain will contain `Movies`, each of it will have `Persons` in different relationships.
We have the `Actors`, `Directors` and `Reviewers`.

Defining the needed domain classes, results in the following code.

[source, java]
----
class Movie {
    String title;
    List<Actor> actors;
    List<Person> directors;
    List<Reviewer> reviewers;
}

class Person {
    String name;
}

class Actor {
	List<String> roles;

	Movie movie;
	Person person;
}

class Reviewer {
	String review;
	int rating;

	Movie movie;
	Person person;
}
----

Whenever a `Person` acted in a `Movie`, she or he played a certain or multiple characters (`roles`).
To model this, we add relationship entities to the model that are known as relationship entity, in this case `Actor`.

We prepare a similar relationship representation for the `Person` who reviewed a `Movie` and call it `Reviewer`.
