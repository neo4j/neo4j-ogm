= Configuring Neo4j OGM for High Availability (HA)


[[reference-configuration-transactions]]
== Transaction binding in HA mode

A typical Neo4j HA cluster will consist of a master node and a couple of slave nodes for providing failover capability and optionally for handling reads.
(Although it is possible to write to slaves, this is uncommon because it requires additional effort to synchronise a slave with the master node)

When operating in HA mode, Neo4j does not make open transactions available across all nodes in the cluster.
This means we must bind every request within a specific transaction to the same node in the cluster, or the commit will fail with `404 Not Found`.

[[reference-configuration-readwrite]]
== Read-only transactions

As of Version 2.0.5 read-only transactions are supported by the OGM.

=== API changes

There is new API method `session.beginTransaction(Transaction.Type)` where Transaction.Type is one of:

- READ_WRITE
- READ_ONLY

In the case that your code doesn't declare an explicit transaction, `autocommit` transactions (or their logical equivalent) will be created by the various drivers. These will be READ_WRITE.

The previous API semantics have not changed, i.e. `session.beginTransaction()` creates a READ_WRITE transaction.

=== Drivers
The Drivers have been updated to transmit additional information about the transaction type of the current transaction to the server.

- The HttpDriver implementation sets a Http Header "X-WRITE" to "1" for READ_WRITE transactions (the default) or to "0" for READ_ONLY ones.

- The Embedded Driver can support both READ_ONLY and READ_WRITE (as of version `2.1.0`).

- The native Bolt Driver currently has no support for READ_ONLY transactions or READ_ONLY sessions, so the implementation of this in the OGM is also on hold until this capability becomes available.



[[reference-configuration-haproxy]]
== Dynamic binding via a load balancer

In the Neo4j HA architecture, a cluster is typically fronted by a load balancer.

The following example shows how to configure your application and set up HAProxy as a load balancer to route write requests to whichever machine in the cluster is currently identified as the master, with read requests being distributed to any available machine in the cluster on a round-robin basis.

This configuration will also ensure that requests against a specific transaction are directed to the server where the transaction was created.

=== Example cluster fronted by HAProxy

. haproxy:          10.0.2.200
. neo4j-server1:    10.0.1.10
. neo4j-server2:    10.0.1.11
. neo4j-server3:    10.0.1.12
