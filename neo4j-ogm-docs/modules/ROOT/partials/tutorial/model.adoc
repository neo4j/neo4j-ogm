= Building the domain model

Before we get to any code, we want to whiteboard our graph model.

Our college will contain `departments`, each of which offer various `subjects` taught by a `teacher`.
`Students` `enroll` for `courses` or `classes` that teach a `subject`.

We're also going to model a `study buddy` which represents a group of `students` that get together to help one another study for a `class`.

Here's what we came up with.

When we translate this model to Groovy, it ends up being pretty straightforward:

[source, groovy]
----
class Department {
    String name;
    Set<Subject> subjects;
}

class Subject {
    String name;
    Department department;
    Set<Teacher> teachers;
    Set<Course> courses;
}

class Teacher {
    String name;
    Set<Course> courses;
    Set<Subject> subjects;
}

class Course {
    String name;
    Subject subject;
    Teacher teacher;
    Set<Enrollment> enrollments;
}

class Student {
    String name;
    Set<Enrollment> enrollments;
    Set<StudyBuddy> studyBuddies;
}

class Enrollment {
    Student student;
    Course course;
    Date enrolledDate;
}
----

When a student enrolls for a course, we're also going to keep track of the enrollment date.

In the model, this will be stored as a property on the `ENROLLED` relationship between a student and a course.
This kind of rich relationship is managed by the class `Enrollment` and is known as a ***relationship entity***.

The important thing to take away here is that Neo4j-OGM supports Neo4j's philosophy of whiteboard friendly domain models.
By focusing on the model the code almost writes itself.
