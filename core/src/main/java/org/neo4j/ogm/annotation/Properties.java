/**
 * Tells OGM to map values of a Map field in a node or relationship entity to properties of a node or a relationship
 * in the graph.
 * The property names are derived from field name or {@link #prefix()}, delimiter and keys in the Map. If the delimiter,
 * prefix or keys conflict with other field names in the class the behaviour is not defined.
 * Supported types for keys in the Map are String and Enum.
 * The values in the Map can be of any Java type equivalent to Cypher types. If full type information is provided other
 * Java types are also supported.
 * If {@link #allowCast()} is set to true then types that can be cast to corresponding Cypher types are allowed as well.
 * Note that the original type cannot be deduced and the value will be deserialized to corresponding type - e.g.
 * when Integer instance is put to {@code Map<String, Object>} it will be deserialized as Long.
