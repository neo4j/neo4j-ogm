/**
 * Represents the primary unique constraint used to reference an EntityNode.
 * <p>When using an @Id on a class attribute, this attribute will be considered as the key of the entity,
 * and saving to the database will trigger a merge on an existing entry with the same key if it exists.
 * The @Id annotated attribute can either be assigned manually by the user (default), or can be generated
 * by OGM (see @{@link GeneratedValue}}.
 * <p>This comes as a more explicit replacement to the old {@link Index}(primary = true, unique = true) annotation.
