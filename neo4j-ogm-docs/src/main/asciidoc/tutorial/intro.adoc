Neo4j-OGM Movies is an example application that allows you to manage movies, person related to the movies and ratings.

Although the functionality is reduced to show the needed steps to work with Neo4j-OGM,
it contains all the layers you would expect to exist in a real world application.

We intentionally decided to not depend on any external framework (like Spring or Quarkus) in this example and exclude e.g. the web part,
to avoid the extra bit of complexity those bring with them.
As a benefit, we can more focus on the behaviour of Neo4j-OGM.

The complete source code for the application is available on https://github.com/neo4j-ogm/neo4j-ogm-example[Github].
