= Migration from 2.1 to 3.0

This migration guide should help with migration from OGM 2.1.x version to 3.0.x.

== Field access only

Probably the most invasive change is how OGM accesses entity fields.
Up to version 2.1.x any setters/getters took precedence before direct field access.
This was also the reason why some annotations had to be on both setters and getters/fields and was a frequent source of
confusion and many questions on Slack and StackOverflow.

Since version 3.0.0 all properties and relationships are accessed (read and write) by direct field access only.
All annotations on getters or setters must be moved to field directly.
If there is an annotation duplicated on both field and setter/getter, only the annotation on the field should stay.

[NOTE]
The `@Target` type of the annotations (`@Relationship`, `@Property`, etc.)` was changed to `ElementType.FIELD`,
so you can easily identify places which needs updating by trying to compile your project.

It was possible to perform some initialisation, validation or logic in annotated setters.
New annotation @PostLoad was introduced to allow for any such action after the entity is fully hydrated.


== Configuration

New class Configuration.Builder was introduced for java configuration using properties or property file.
See <<configuration.adoc#, configuration>> section and JavaDoc for details.

`Components` class was removed, if you need to provide custom driver instance use appropriate constructor of SessionFactory.


== Performance and unlimited load depth

In order to improve loading performance, some optimizations are now used by OGM when querying.
A new load policy based on list comprehension generated from schema is now used.
(see https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/syntax/lists/#cypher-list-comprehension[here] for details)

It means that, instead of loading blindly object graphs up to a certain depth, OGM will now only query the nodes and
relationships that are expressed in your domain model.
For applications that do not require following all the relationships, this can be a huge performance improvement.

However, this new load strategy does not support unlimited depth (depth = -1).
Either use specific depth or use `PATH_BASED_LOAD_STRATEGY`, to revert to the old strategy.

[source,java]
----
session.setLoadStrategy(LoadStrategy.PATH_LOAD_STRATEGY);
----

[NOTE]
Default depth for `Session.load*` methods without depth parameter is 1, so there is no need to change anything.
Only calls with explicit `depth = -1` need to be changed.


== Migration checklist

Here are the things you (may) have to adapt :

* The `ogm.properties` file and environment variable have been removed. You now have to provide explicitly the configuration file or configure programmatically. See <<configuration.adoc#reference:configuration:driver, the configuration section>>
* The driver class name in the configuration is now inferred from connection URL
* TBC
