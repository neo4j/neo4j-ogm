/**
 * This interface can be implemented by extensions that wish to modify Cypher statements before they are being sent
 * by corresponding OGM driver to the database.<br>
 * <br>
 * OGM makes sure that the modification will be applied to all statements, regardless of source, but implementations of
 * the service must not rely on the fact that the modification happens currently on the drivers level, which may change
 * without notice.<br>
 * <br>
 * To add your custom modification, create a separate module, implement this interface and return an arbitrary
 * {@link java.util.function.Function}. As an optional step, overwrite the {@link #getOrder()} method in case you have
 * multiple modifications on the class path. The lower the value it returns, the higher it's priority. Higher priority
 * means modification is applied first.<br>
 * <br>
 * OGM loads implementations through Java's builtin Service Provider Interfache mechanism.
 * Please refer to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/SPI-intro.html">Oracle's</a>
 * documentation of Java's Service Provide Interface to declare your implementation. In short: Define a file called
 * <code>META-INF/services/org.neo4j.ogm.spi.CypherModificationProvider</code> in your module containing the fully qualified
 * name of your <code>CypherModificationProvider</code>-Implementation.<br>
 * <br>
 * Inside the function returned by {@link #getCypherModification(Map)}} the Cypher modification itself is supposed to happend.
 * The function is called with the Cypher string generated by OGM or passed to the Session interface and is then supposed
 * to return a non null, non empty string.<br>
 * <br>
 * The map passed to {@link #getCypherModification(Map)}} contains arbitrary properties from OGMs
 * {@link org.neo4j.ogm.config.Configuration}. Those can be set programmatically in any way necessary. Use those properties
 * to configure your Cypher modification as needed.
